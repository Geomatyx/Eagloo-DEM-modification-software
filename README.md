## 1 | Introduction
Eagloo is a package designed for simplified the modification and analysis of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). It is made to co-register, subtract, interpolate, compute errors, calculate mass and volume, and automatically generate a synthetic PDF.
It is a tool for researchers, scientists, and anyone working with DEMs.
  
## 2 | Features
This software offers a variety of features to help you analyse your DEMs, including:
  
### - Co-registration: 
Eagloo offers multiple co-registration methods, including Nuth and K채채b, Iterative Closest Point (ICP), and ICP + Nuth and K채채b.

### - Subtraction: 
Easily subtract one DEM from another to analyze changes in terrain over time.

### - Interpolation: 
Eagloo's interpolation capabilities include:
  1. Linear interpolation
  2. Hypsometric interpolation
  3. Local hypsometric interpolation

### - Errors:
Errors can be calculated through those different methods: 
  1. Unstandardized non-stationnarity errors 
  2. Standardized non-stationnarity errors
  3. Integrated and mean standardized error

### - Mass and volume calculation: 
Calculate the mass and volume of specific areas within your DEMs.

### - Synthetic PDF generation: 
Eagloo can automatically generate a synthetic PDF to help you quickly and easily visualize your analysis results.

## 4 | Installation
Eagloo is only available on Linux.
  1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/Geomatyx/Eagloo_software.git
  2. Install dependencies, right-click on "installing_dependencies.sh" and click on "run as program" (if "run as program" is not displayed: Preferences -> Permissions -> "Allow executing file as program")
  3. Open the software, right-click on "Eagloo_software.sh" and click on "run as program" (if "run as program" is not displayed: Preferences -> Permissions -> "Allow executing file as program")

## 5 | Work carried out 
The work is consisting to:
- Create a user interface that allows the use of specific functions for processing and analyzing digital elevation models (DEMs) without any knowledge of code
- Improve the efficiency of DEM processing by using a pipeline approach
- Create of a function for automatically generate reports

## 6 | External Open Source ressources used
Various external libraries and packages were utilized, with the most frequently used resources presented below. A comprehensive list of all libraries used can be found [here](#9 | Recognition of Open Source use).

### Frontend
The user interface was developed using the [PySimpleGUI] (https://www.pysimplegui.org/en/latest/) package (under GNU GPL license).

### Processing data
To modify certain input and output data, the [GDAL](https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal) framework was utilized (under MIT license).

### Co-registration, Interpolation, Errors
The functions used for co-registration, interpolation, and calculating errors of the digital elevation models (DEMs) are from the [xDEM](https://github.com/GlacioHack/xdem) package (under MIT license).

### PDF 
To automatically generate a PDF report, the [FPDF](http://www.fpdf.org/) library was utilized(no usage restriction).
