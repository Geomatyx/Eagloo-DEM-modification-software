<h2> <div style="padding-left: 20px;">1 | Introduction</div>  </h2>
Eagloo is a software designed for co-registering and analyzing Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). With Eagloo, you can easily co-register, subtract, interpolate, calculate mass and volume, and automatically generate a synthetic PDF. Eagloo is a tool for researchers, scientists, and anyone working with DEMs.

<h2 align="left">   2 | Features</h2>
Eagloo offers a variety of features to help you analyse your DEMs, including:

### a | Co-registration: 
Eagloo offers multiple co-registration methods, including Nuth and K채채b, Iterative Closest Point (ICP), and ICP + Nuth and K채채b.

### b | Subtraction: 
Easily subtract one DEM from another to analyze changes in terrain over time.

### c | Interpolation: 
Eagloo's interpolation capabilities include:
  1. Linear interpolation
  2. Hypsometric interpolation
  3. Local hypsometric interpolation

### d | Mass and volume calculation: 
Calculate the mass and volume of specific areas within your DEMs.

### e | Synthetic PDF generation: 
Eagloo can automatically generate a synthetic PDF to help you quickly and easily visualize your analysis results.
