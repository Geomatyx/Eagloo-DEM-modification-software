  Eagloo Software
Eagloo is powerful software designed for co-registering and analyzing Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). With Eagloo, you can easily co-register, subtract, interpolate, calculate mass and volume, and automatically generate a synthetic PDF.

Features
Eagloo offers a variety of features to help you analyze your DEMs, including:

Co-registration: Eagloo offers multiple co-registration methods, including Nuth and Kääb, Iterative Closest Point (ICP), and ICP with Nuth and Kääb.

Subtraction: Easily subtract one DEM from another to analyze changes in terrain over time.

Interpolation: Eagloo's interpolation capabilities include linear interpolation, hypsometric interpolation, and local hypsometric interpolation.

Mass and Volume Calculation: Calculate the mass and volume of specific areas within your DEMs.

Synthetic PDF Generation: Eagloo can automatically generate a synthetic PDF to help you quickly and easily visualize your analysis results.

Eagloo is a powerful tool for researchers, scientists, and anyone working with DEMs. Whether you need to co-register, subtract, interpolate, or calculate mass and volume, Eagloo has you covered.
