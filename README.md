## 1 | Introduction
This software is designed for simplified some Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) modelisation. It is made to co-register, subtract, interpolate, calculate mass and volume, and automatically generate a synthetic PDF. Eagloo is a tool for researchers, scientists, and anyone working with DEMs.

## 2 | Purposes of this software  
- Create a user interface that allows the use of specific functions for processing and analyzing digital elevation models (DEMs) without any knowledge of code.
- Improve the efficiency of DEM processing by providing an easier method for selecting input data using a pipeline approach.
- Automatically generate reports.

## 3 | External Open Source ressources used
Various external libraries and frameworks were utilized, with the most frequently used resources presented below. A comprehensive list of all libraries used can be found at the bottom of the page.

### Frontend
The user interface was developed using the [PySimpleGUI](https://www.pysimplegui.org/en/latest/)(under GNU GPL license) library.

### Processing data
To modify certain input and output data, the [GDAL](https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal)(under MIT license) framework was utilized.

### Co-registration, Interpolation, Errors
The functions used for co-registration, interpolation, and calculating errors of the digital elevation models (DEMs) are from the [xDEM](https://github.com/GlacioHack/xdem)(under MIT license).

### PDF 
To automatically generate a PDF report, the [FPDF](http://www.fpdf.org/)(no usage restriction) library was utilized. 

## 4 | Features
Eagloo offers a variety of features to help you analyse your DEMs, including:

### - Co-registration: 
Eagloo offers multiple co-registration methods, including Nuth and K채채b, Iterative Closest Point (ICP), and ICP + Nuth and K채채b.

### - Subtraction: 
Easily subtract one DEM from another to analyze changes in terrain over time.

### - Interpolation: 
Eagloo's interpolation capabilities include:
  1. Linear interpolation
  2. Hypsometric interpolation
  3. Local hypsometric interpolation

### - Mass and volume calculation: 
Calculate the mass and volume of specific areas within your DEMs.

### - Synthetic PDF generation: 
Eagloo can automatically generate a synthetic PDF to help you quickly and easily visualize your analysis results.
